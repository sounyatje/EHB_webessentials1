    <p>Stephen King's best adapted movie
        I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw <b> Shawshank Redemption </b>. Shawshank encompasses
        friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives
        you hope.
        Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that
        far removed from what the characters are going through.

        King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest
        stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly
        interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank
        Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants
        to say and he conveys that beautifully.

        What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy
        Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope.
        He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not
        only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has
        never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.</p>
